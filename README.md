# Evaluating-the-efficiency-of-Platt-SMO-algorithm
This repository contains all necessary files for the implementation Sequential Minimal Optimization (SMO) algorithm. The algorithm is also applied on a practical dataset to study the time complexity.

# Components of this project:
- data_preprocessing.py: A file containing methods to pre-process and load data.
- kernel.py: A file containing both linear and gaussian kernel for SMO.
- SMO.py: A file containing the implementation of Platt SMO algorithm.
- main.py: This is the main file of the project. Run it to test the performance of implemented SMO. 
- Report.pdf: It is located in documents folder. This file contains all documentation of my implementation as well as the time complexity result.
